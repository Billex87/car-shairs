Thanks for viewing my project.
I did my best to use what was on your website already, with the green i everywhere I could, and I used your color pallette for the greens, the greys and whites as much as I could.

I have sent you the zip file for ease.
Simply open the file, run "npm i" to install dependencies.
Then run "npm start" which will take you to localhost:3000 to view my project.

Interactions:

You are given two drop down menus and a slider to work with. Simply pick your make, the year and what type of car to search for your car shair.

You will receive an error letting the user know to select from all parameters before being able to filter to your desired output.

Once you successfully make a search, you are given the models of the shair-able vehicles along with a clickable button for more info and a booking button.

Of course the footer contains five social icons that will send you to your actual social media accounts and of course in a new tab so you do not lose progress on finding your dream ride shair.
